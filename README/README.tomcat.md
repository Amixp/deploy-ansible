# Dirs

$CATALINA_HOME - the root of your Tomcat installation

- /bin - Startup, shutdown, and other scripts. The *.sh files (for Unix systems) are functional duplicates of the *.bat files (for Windows systems). Since the Win32 command-line lacks certain functionality, there are some additional files in here.

- /conf - Configuration files and related DTDs. The most important file in here is server.xml. It is the main configuration file for the container.

- /logs - Log files are here by default.

- /webapps - This is where your webapps go.
